![Disaster Tweets Classification](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/nlp1-cover.jpg)

This repository contains the code and resources for a project that tackles the "Disaster Tweets" problem from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify tweets as either related to a disaster or not.

## Problem Description

The "Disaster Tweets" problem is a natural language processing (NLP) task where we aim to classify tweets into two categories: those that are related to a real disaster and those that are not. This classification task is valuable for various applications, such as disaster response and monitoring systems.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's "Disaster Tweets" competition. It consists of a large collection of tweets that are labeled as either disaster-related or non-disaster-related. The dataset contains text features, such as the tweet content, as well as the corresponding labels indicating whether each tweet is related to a disaster or not.

## Approach

To solve the problem of classifying disaster tweets, we employ the following approach:

1. Data Preprocessing: We perform various text preprocessing steps, including tokenization, removing stopwords, and handling special characters or URLs.

2. Feature Extraction: We transform the preprocessed text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms. This step involves the technique called word embeddings.

3. Model Selection: We experiment the machine learning model called GPT-2 . In this project, we utilize the PyTorch framework to implement and train our models.

4. Model Training: We split the dataset into training and validation sets and train the selected model using the training data. We employ appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance during training.

5. Model Evaluation: We evaluate the trained model on the validation set to measure its performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.


## Framework and Dependencies

This project utilizes the following framework:
